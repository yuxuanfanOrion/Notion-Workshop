# Notion Workshop

**[English](./README.md)** | **[中文](./README_CN.md)**

Hi, this is [Eason](https://yuxuanfanorion.github.io/).

This project is still under development. Feel free to open issues or PRs.

This project will be published to the VS Code Marketplace later.

A VS Code extension that lets you browse Notion pages, open them locally as Markdown, edit, and push changes back to Notion.

## ✨ Features

- 🌳 Native tree view for pages and sub-pages
- 📄 Click a page to open it (auto-pull)
- 🔄 Auto-push on save with smart debouncing (2s delay)
- ⚡ Parallel API requests for fast sync
- 💾 Request caching to reduce API calls
- 🗂️ Local sync folders with per-page `<title>.md` (file + folder side by side)
- 📝 Rich block type support (headings, toggles, tables, callouts, and more)

See [Format Mapping](./docs/format-mapping.md) for the complete list of supported Notion blocks.

## 📋 Requirements

- VS Code 1.85+
- A Notion integration token
- The root page shared with your integration

### Step 2: Share Pages with Your Integration

2. Click the **•••** menu in the top right
3. Select **Add connections** → Choose your integration

### Step 3: Configure the Extension

2. Look for the **Notion** icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
3. Click **Configure Notion** or run command: `Notion: Login/Configure`

### Step 4: Start Working

1. Click **Refresh** (🔄) in the Notion sidebar
2. Your shared pages will appear in the tree view
3. Click any page to open it locally as Markdown
4. Edit and save — changes auto-push to Notion after 2 seconds
